🌟 Navi-Phone 📱✨
Everyone is connected where ever you are.

Stay connected wherever you are—it's the future at your fingertips!

I got inspired to create this project after coming across a stunning 3D model of the Navi-Phone. While researching, I stumbled upon this awesome YouTube video: 3D Model of Navi-Phone. 🎥
🛠️ The Journey So Far

I’ve been working on the STL files using Blender, and I now have four revisions of the model lying around! 😅 (You know how it goes—tweaks on tweaks on tweaks!)

🤔 What's a CYD?

Good question!
The Navi-Phone project uses a Raspberry Pi 3 B in the original video, but I decided to use a CYD (Cheap Yellow Display).

It’s a display with an ESP32 microcontroller. 
A big shoutout to this amazing GitHub project: https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display and their Discord community! 💬 Special thanks to Princess Pixie for motivating me to push forward! 🚀

Here’s what the CYD looks like:

🖥️ Programming Details

The entire program is written in MicroPython, using the Thonny IDE. 🐍✨ While I haven’t had time to write full documentation, I’ve shared my notes here:
